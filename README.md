# Amazon Deforestation Analysis Project

## Topic Proposal

### Adam Amar

The Amazon rainforest, known as the "lungs of the Earth," is one of the largest ecosystems on the planet. It plays a vital role in preserving biodiversity, stabilizing the global climate, and maintaining the living conditions of indigenous people. However, extensive deforestation and overexploitation have put this critical ecosystem at risk. 

This project leverages **Google Earth Pro's** powerful geospatial analysis tools to explore the causes and effects of deforestation in the Amazon in detail.

### Key Issues Addressed

This project focuses on the following major issues related to the increasing pace of deforestation in the Amazon:

- **Loss of Biodiversity**: Documenting the spatial extent of deforestation and its impact on the rich flora and fauna.
  
- **Native American Land Displacement**: Examining how deforestation is encroaching on native lands, and analyzing land use changes that lead to the relocation of indigenous communities.
  
- **Air Quality and Climate Impact**: Using satellite imagery to identify areas of increased deforestation and their potential contribution to climate change. We will explore the relationship between deforestation and declining air quality.

- **Water Levels and Hydrography**: Analyzing water level changes and predicting future patterns by observing shifts in river flow and aquatic ecosystems.

### GIS Component and Analysis

A significant aspect of this project will be its Geographic Information System (GIS) component, which will combine various geographic data layers for in-depth analysis. The tools in **Google Earth Pro** will be used to achieve the following:

1. **Deforestation Observation**: 
   - Using satellite imagery from different periods, we will map variations in land cover, focusing on deforested areas.
   
2. **Indigenous Land Mapping**:
   - Mapping indigenous territories and overlaying this data on deforestation maps to assess the effects on native populations.

3. **Air Quality Modeling**:
   - Correlating satellite-based air quality data with deforestation hotspots to better understand environmental impacts.

4. **Hydrography Analysis**:
   - Investigating historical and current river flow patterns and water levels, using GIS tools to draw conclusions about changes in aquatic ecosystems.

### Project Approach

This project will conduct a **temporal analysis of deforestation patterns** using satellite imagery over time. By combining these visual representations with online reports, the project aims to create a comprehensive picture of the extent and consequences of deforestation in the Amazon.

The outcome will include detailed images produced from **Google Earth Pro**, effectively illustrating the magnitude of deforestation and its effects on the environment and indigenous communities.
